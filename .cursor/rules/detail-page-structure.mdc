Special Design Patterns
Block Organization: Content is grouped into logical blocks with consistent styling
Badges: Visual status indicators (SubscribedBadge, AccountStatusBadge, CompanyBadge)
Copy Values: Email/phone can be copied with NeviosCopyBlock
Responsive Layout: Two-column layout on desktop, stacks on mobile
Server Actions: Uses React Server Actions (modifyCustomer, deleteCustomer, etc.) for backend operations
The page presents a detailed customer view with data split into logical sections, provides edit capabilities through modals, and maintains a consistent design system with other pages in the admin dashboard.

NeviosBadge
This component creates consistent, color-coded badges for different states:
Props:
badgeVariant: Color scheme (blue, green, red, yellow, orange, gray)
icon: Optional icon displayed before text
children: Text content inside the badge
customSx: Optional custom styling
Design System:
Each variant has pre-defined colors for background, text, and border
Consistent padding, border-radius, and font weights
Compact design (fit-content width)
Badge Implementation Pattern
In your CustomerView component, you're using several badge implementations:
SubscribedBadge: Shows email subscription status
AccountStatusBadge: Shows account activation status
CompanyBadge: Shows if customer is a business
These specialized badges likely inherit from NeviosBadge with pre-configured variants and icons. For example:
Apply to detail-page-...
}
This approach ensures visual consistency while making the code more readable - rather than specifying badge properties each time, you use semantic components that communicate their purpose.
To create new state badges, follow this pattern of wrapping NeviosBadge with specific configurations for your use case.
